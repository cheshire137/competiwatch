      <dt class="mb-1">Does Competiwatch log my matches for me?</dt>
      <dd class="mb-4">
        No. You have to manually enter data after your games in order to see
        trends and other data about your competitive season. You might be interested
        in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overtrack.gg/">OverTrack</a> if you want automated tracking.
      </dd>
      <dt class="mb-1">How much data do I have to enter when logging matches?</dt>
      <dd class="mb-4">
        <p>If you choose to log your placement matches individually, the result of the match
        (win/loss/draw) is required. If you want to skip logging placements and only log
        your starting SR, that SR is required. For regular matches, only your new SR is
        required.</p>
        All other fields, like the map, heroes you played, and friends you grouped
        with, are optional. However, if you don't fill in a field, you won't see trends
        about it. For example, if you never log the map you played on, you won't see a
        chart of win percentage by map.

      <dt class="mb-1">Where do I get CSV files to import match data?</dt>
      <dd class="mb-4">
        If you've been logging your competitive matches in a spreadsheet with a tool
        like Excel or Google Sheets, you can produce a CSV (comma-separated value) file
        of the data you've already logged. Then you can import this CSV file into
        Competiwatch so you don't have to manually re-enter all those matches.

        It's free! ðŸŽ‰ See <a href="<%= about_path %>">the about page</a> for
        more information, but Competiwatch is my hobby project. I want to keep costs down
        such that I can offer it for free.
